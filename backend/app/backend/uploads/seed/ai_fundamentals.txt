Artificial Intelligence (AI) combines data, algorithms, and computing power to
create systems that learn from experience. Effective flashcards isolate single
concepts—definitions, formulas, process steps—so the learner can practice active
recall. Lessons should always close with a reflective prompt that checks for
understanding and encourages knowledge transfer to real scenarios.
